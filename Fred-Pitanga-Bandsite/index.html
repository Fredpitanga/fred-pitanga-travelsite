                    <h4 class="about__bio-main">Beyoncé Knowles-Carter was born September 4th, 1981 in Houston, Texas. Her father Mathew Knowles was a businessman, and her mother Tina Knowles (Lawson) was a hairdresser. Her younger sister, singer-songwriter Solange, was born June 26th, 1986. Beyoncé’s career in music and dance began as a small child. She was enrolled in dance classes and attended art schools in the Houston area. She ventured into singing through local talent shows and becoming a part of her school and church choirs.

                        Her love for singing and performing became more than a hobby in 1992, when Beyoncé, along with her family friend Kelly Rowland and LaTavia Robinson, auditioned for an all-girls R&B group that would eventually become Girl’s Tyme. Girl’s Tyme added three other members for a total of 6, and appeared on the hit television talent show Star Search. The group unfortunately lost Star Search, but their appearance on the show motivated them to work harder. Beyoncé’s father Matthew Knowles began to manage the group, cutting it down to four members, adding LeToya Luckett, and booking them at local gigs around Houston.</h4>
                    <h4 class="about__bio-main" id="main-bot"><h4> With over 25 years of experience in music, Beyoncé is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, the most Grammy nominated woman artist, and arguably one of the greatest entertainers in history. Her work and career have inspired contemporary music artists such Normani, Ariana Grande, Adele, and Sam Smith in the same way Beyoncé has been inspired by other legends. Throughout her career, she has cited Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, Aretha Franklin, and Tina Turner, who has inspired Beyoncé’s energetic performing style, as her influences. She has also credited Anita Baker, Mary J. Blige, Selena, Aaliyah and Madonna as other influences of hers..</h4>
